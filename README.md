JavaScript on the web browser is a programming language that's used to make websites interactive. 
It helps in creating dynamic content, handling events like clicks and form submissions, and modifying the webpage in real-time. JavaScript is often used alongside HTML and CSS to enhance user experience by making web pages more responsive and functional.
It's a crucial part of web development and allows for the creation of engaging and interactive web applications.
