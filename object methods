Key Concepts:
Objects and Functions:

Objects can hold different types of data, including primitive types, arrays, and even other objects.
Functions are treated as values in JavaScript, and they can be added to objects as properties.
Object Methods:

Functions added to objects are called methods.
Methods are accessed like other properties, using dot notation or bracket notation.
Using this Keyword:

The this keyword refers to the object that is calling the method.
It allows methods to access and manipulate the data within the object without explicitly passing it as parameters.
Efficient Property Retrieval:

Methods can be used to calculate a value once and store it as a property in the object for later retrieval.
This approach enhances efficiency, especially when the computation is resource-intensive.
