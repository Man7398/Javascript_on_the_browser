Objects in jS
________________________

"Objects in JS" in JavaScript hold lots of related info, like a box holding different items â€“
such as fruit color, size, and taste. They organize data about things, like a car or a person, using properties as labels for the info inside. For instance,
a car object can have properties like "color" or "model," each with specific info. 
It helps tidy up related info!
