# JavaScript Objects, Methods, Sets, Maps, and JSON Explained

## üóíÔ∏è Answer

1. **JavaScript Objects:**
   - Objects in JavaScript are like containers that hold key-value pairs.
   - Example: `let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };`
   - Access values using `object.key` syntax.
   - Objects are versatile and used for data representation.

2. **JavaScript Methods:**
   - Methods are functions that belong to objects.
   - Example: `object.method()`.
   - Perform actions or calculations on objects.
   - Widely used in programming for reusable code.

3. **Sets:**
   - Sets in JavaScript store unique values.
   - Created using `new Set()`.
   - Ideal for managing lists with distinct elements.
   - Methods like `add()`, `delete()`, and `has()` for manipulation.

4. **Maps:**
   - Maps are ordered collections of key/value pairs.
   - Introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
   - Use methods like `set()`, `get()`, and `delete()`.

5. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):**
   - Lightweight data interchange format.
   - Easy-to-read text format for data objects.
   - Commonly used for API communication.
   - Example: `{"name":"John","age":30,"city":"New York"}`.

6. **JSON Data Types:**
   - JSON supports data types like number, string, object, boolean, array, or null.
   - Key-value pairs separated by a colon.
   - Widely used for data exchange between a server and web application.
