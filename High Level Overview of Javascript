In this theory section, we're going to provide a broad introduction to JavaScript. Prepare yourself for a comprehensive overview!

JavaScript is a programming language that is high-level, object-oriented and supports multiple programming styles. Let's break this down. 
It's also prototype-based, and it can be interpreted or just-in-time compiled. It has dynamic typing, operates on a single thread, performs garbage collection, 
and features first-class functions with a non-blocking event loop for concurrency.

High-level languages like JavaScript handle resource management more abstractly, making them user-friendly but potentially slower. 
Garbage collection helps with automatic memory management.

When it comes to the execution of JavaScript, it can be either interpreted or just-in-time compiled.
While computers only understand zeros and ones, we write code in JavaScript, which is human-readable. 
The JavaScript engine then translates it into machine code.

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language that supports various programming approaches such as procedural, 
object-oriented, and functional programming. 
This flexibility allows us to choose the programming style that suits us best.

In terms of object-oriented programming, JavaScript uses a prototype-based approach.
Practically everything is treated as an object, and arrays, 
for example, inherit methods from a prototype.

Functions in JavaScript are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed around and returned.
This feature enables powerful techniques and supports functional programming.

JavaScript has dynamic typing, which means variable types are determined at runtime. This aspect of JavaScript is often debated but is inherent to the language's nature.

The concurrency model in JavaScript involves a single thread and
a non-blocking event loop. This means that long-running tasks are handled in the background
to prevent blocking the main thread.

This overview establishes the foundation for our in-depth exploration of JavaScript,
where we will cover these topics and more. Don't worry about feeling overwhelmed; 
it's important to grasp the big picture before diving into specifics.
