Essential Array Methods in JavaScript Explained

Introduction:
JavaScript provides a variety of built-in functions known as methods that can be directly applied to arrays. These methods serve as array operations, making it crucial to understand and incorporate them into your coding repertoire. In this tutorial, we will focus on some fundamental array methods to help you get accustomed to using them.

Array Methods:

push():

Adds elements to the end of an array.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
friends.push('Jay');
unshift():

Adds elements to the beginning of an array.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
friends.unshift('John');
pop():

Removes the last element from the array.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
let popped = friends.pop();
shift():

Removes the first element from the array.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
let removed = friends.shift();
indexOf():

Returns the index of a specified element in the array.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
let index = friends.indexOf('Steven');
includes():

Returns true if the array includes a specified element; otherwise, returns false.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
if (friends.includes('Peter')) {
  console.log('You have a friend called Peter.');
}
Conclusion:
These are foundational array methods in JavaScript that enable efficient manipulation of arrays. While there are many more advanced methods available, mastering these basics is essential. Practice using them in different scenarios to enhance your understanding of array operations in JavaScript.
