**Primitives vs. Objects in JavaScript:**

**Primitives:**
- **Examples:** Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt.
- **Storage:** Stored directly in the call stack.
- **Behavior:** Copied by value.
- **Immutability:** Values are immutable (unchangeable).

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = x;
x = 10;
console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 5
```

**Objects:**
- **Examples:** Arrays, Functions, Objects.
- **Storage:** Reference types stored in the heap; variables hold references in the call stack.
- **Behavior:** Copied by reference.
- **Mutability:** Values can be changed (mutable).

```javascript
let obj1 = { name: "John" };
let obj2 = obj1;
obj2.name = "Jane";
console.log(obj1.name); // "Jane"
console.log(obj2.name); // "Jane"
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Primitives are copied by their actual value, creating independent copies.
- Objects are copied by reference, leading to shared references to the same object.
- Understanding this distinction is crucial for handling data in JavaScript effectively.

Absolutely! Here's a concise summary of the key points from this section:

**Primitive Values vs. Reference Values:**

1. **Primitive Values:**
   - Stored in the call stack.
   - Variables directly hold the actual value.
   - Independent copies are created when assigning variables.

2. **Reference Values:**
   - Objects are stored in the heap.
   - Variables hold references (memory addresses) to actual objects.
   - Assigning a variable to another shares the reference, affecting both variables.

**Copying Objects:**
   - Assigning an object creates a new reference, not a copy.
   - Modifications through one reference impact all references to the same object.

**Constants and Mutability:**
   - `const` does not make objects immutable.
   - Prevents reassignment of the variable, but object modifications are allowed.

**Memory Allocation:**
   - Primitive values stored directly in the stack.
   - Reference values stored in the heap; variables hold references.

**Key Takeaways:**
   - Primitives are copied by value, creating independence.
   - Reference values are copied by reference, leading to shared objects.
   - Constants prevent variable reassignment but not object modification.
   - Awareness of memory allocation aids understanding JavaScript behavior.

**Upcoming Topics:**
   - Prototypal Inheritance: Covered in Object-Oriented Programming.
   - Event Loop: In-depth coverage in Asynchronous JavaScript.
   - DOM Behind the Scenes: Explored in Advanced DOM and Events.

Understanding these fundamentals provides a strong foundation for mastering JavaScript and prepares for more advanced topics in later course sections.
