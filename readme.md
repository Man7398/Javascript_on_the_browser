# Javascript_on_the_browser-(Inspired from the JonasSchemedit Coding Prog)
JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive websites on web browsers. It is an important part of web development and is often used together with HTML and CSS to improve user experience. With JavaScript, web developers can create dynamic content, manage events like clicks and form submissions, and make real-time changes to web pages, making them more responsive and functional. JavaScript enables the creation of engaging and interactive web applications. (Grammarly 2023)
