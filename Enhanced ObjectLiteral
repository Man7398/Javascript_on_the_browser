It seems like there might be a typo in your question ("enhanced onject litera;"). Assuming you are referring to "enhanced object literals" in JavaScript, I'll provide a brief summary.

Enhanced object literals refer to new features and syntax improvements introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) that make working with objects in JavaScript more convenient and expressive.

Here are some key features of enhanced object literals:

1. **Shorthand Property Names:**
   - Before ES6:

     ```javascript
     const x = 5, y = 10;
     const point = { x: x, y: y };
     ```

   - With ES6:

     ```javascript
     const x = 5, y = 10;
     const point = { x, y };
     ```

   Shorthand property names allow you to use the variable names directly as property names if they match.

2. **Method Shorthand:**
   - Before ES6:

     ```javascript
     const obj = {
       sayHello: function() {
         console.log('Hello');
       }
     };
     ```

   - With ES6:

     ```javascript
     const obj = {
       sayHello() {
         console.log('Hello');
       }
     };
     ```

   Method shorthand provides a more concise way to define methods inside objects.

3. **Computed Property Names:**
   - Before ES6:

     ```javascript
     const propKey = 'dynamicKey';
     const obj = {};
     obj[propKey] = 'someValue';
     ```

   - With ES6:

     ```javascript
     const propKey = 'dynamicKey';
     const obj = {
       [propKey]: 'someValue'
     };
     ```

   Computed property names allow you to use expressions and variables as property names.

These enhancements make the syntax for working with objects more concise and readable, contributing to a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.
