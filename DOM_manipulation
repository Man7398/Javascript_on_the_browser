DOM Manipulation 
________________________

It is like rearranging your room. Imagine your room is a web page, and everything in it is an element (like furniture). 
When you change the position of your desk or move a chair, you're manipulating the layout.
Similarly, with DOM Manipulation, you're basically changing, adding, or removing elements on a web page using code, just like rearranging your room.
You can make things appear, disappear, or move around to create a different look or structure.
It's a way to make a web page more interactive and dynamic, just like giving your room a new feel by moving things around.

# DOM Manipulation in Simple Term

1. **Understanding the DOM:**
   - Think of the DOM as a tree-like structure representing your webpage.
   - Each HTML element (like paragraphs, images) is a node in this tree.

2. **Using JavaScript:**
   - JavaScript helps interact with this tree (DOM).
   - You can add, remove, or modify elements dynamically.

3. **Common Actions:**
   - **Selecting Elements:**
     - Use JavaScript to select HTML elements by their tags, classes, or IDs.
     - Example: `document.getElementById('myElement')`.

   - **Changing Content:**
     - Modify the content inside elements.
     - Example: `element.innerHTML = 'New Content';`.

   - **Styling:**
     - Adjust CSS styles dynamically.
     - Example: `element.style.color = 'red';`.

   - **Adding/Removing Elements:**
     - Insert new elements or remove existing ones.
     - Example: `parentElement.appendChild(newElement);`.

4. **Real-world Example:**
   - When you click a button, JavaScript might change the text on the page or show/hide elements.
